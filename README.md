# Default.sublime-package (downstream/fork)

I use this repository for versioning some files of the Sublime Text default packages
`Default.sublime-package` over git using two repositories strategy:

1. The first repository is mirror of some files I need to change from the latest Sublime Text
   development build version I am using. Every time a new development version is released, and I
   install it, I would unpack it, replace the files on this repository with them and commit its
   changes to this repository. This is a repository just for mirroring them. Would never be send
   changes back to this upstream from a fork repository as at every new release of Sublime Text,
   this mirror (upstream) files would be replaced and any changes would be lost lost.

1. The second repository would be a fork of this upstream mirror, on it would be included changes to
   the files at upstream mirror of Sublime Text default packages `Default.sublime-package`. Every
   Sublime Text development release would be merged the changes from the upstream mirror, if any.
   Therefore we can keep our changes while staying up-to-date with the latest version of
   `Default.sublime-package`.

## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
    ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings – User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
    ],
    ```
1. And,
    change it to the following, i.e.,
    put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
    ],
    ```
    * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
      you will not install this forked version of the package,
      but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
    go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    search for **`Default`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Monkey Patch `sublime` and `sublime_plugin`

On the file `monkey_patch_sublime_modules.py`,
we patch the `sublime` and `sublime_plugin` files because they have some very annoying bugs,
not fixed so far:
1. [SublimeTextIssues/Core#2113](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/2113) OSError: resource not found (Which one?)
   ```python
   raise IOError("resource not found")
   # -->
   raise IOError("resource `%s` not found" % (name))
   ```


## Zzz Reload Default

This repository also has the custom plugin `zz_reload_default_package.py`,
which reload overridden `Default.sublime-package` files because by default,
Sublime Text on start up does not reload the overridden `Default` packages modules on `Packages/Default`.

It also creates the package `0_packages_loader.sublime-package` every time the default settings files on `*.sublime-settings.hide` are updated.
As we ship the `Default.sublime-package` by `PackagesManager`,
we cannot install the `Default.sublime-package` as a `.sublime-package` because we cannot disable the `Default.sublime-package`.
And to update a packed package (`Default.sublime-package`),
we need to disable it before updating.
Then,
we ship it as a unpacked package,
which allows it to be upgraded by `PackagesManager` because we do not need to disable it for updating.

However,
due the settings loader order,
we cannot let Sublime Text find the default settings files `*.sublime-settings` on the unpacked packages directory, otherwise,
it would override all other packages defined settings/keybindings.
Therefore,
we create the `0_packages_loader.sublime-package` on the packed packages directory,
based on the `*.sublime-settings.hide` settings file.


## Synced Side Bar Watcher

This repository also has the custom plugin `synced_side_bar_watcher.py`,
which creates the command `synced_side_bar_reveal_in_side_bar`,
to hide the default context menu command `reveal_in_side_bar`,
when the package `SyncedSideBar` is installed.

How to add/remove a default menu entry when a X package is/isn’t enabled/installed?


## Packages Manager Support

This repository also has the custom plugin `install_package_control_extended.py`,
which creates the command `install_package_control_extended`,
to replace the default context menu command `install_package_control`.

The command `install_package_control_extended` is used to hide the command `install_package_control`
when my fork/version of `Package Control` called `PackagesManager` is installed.
See description and differences from `Package Control` at:
1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/PackagesManager
1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/PackagesManager/commits/master

This is useful,
so the user does not accidentally install 2 Packages Managers which conflicts with each other.
When there is no Packages Manager installed,
the default behavior of the command `install_package_control` still installing the standard `Package Control` is preserved.
